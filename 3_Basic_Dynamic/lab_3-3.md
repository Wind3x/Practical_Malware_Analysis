# Moderately-sized Answers to Short Questions

**1. What do you notice when monitoring this malware with Process Explorer?** 

> The program appears to be obfuscated except for some functions and error messages. The file doesn't seem to be packed if we compare the amount of space each section requires on disk vs in memory. The executable only imports kernel32.dll with notable functions of CreateFileA and Sleep. When executed, the program seems to create a svchost.exe process and then exit, leaving an orphaned svchost process behind. 

**2. Can you identify any live memory modifications?**

> Investigating the strings tab of the svchost.exe properties window, it is obvious that strings in memory differ from strings on disk, suggesting the malware performed process replacement for persistence and stealth. New interesting strings include "practicalmalwareanalysis.log", which suggests that the malware outputs to a log file, and key names such as [ENTER] and BACKSPACE, suggesting the malware may record keystrokes or use these keys as triggers for something. The malware did not create any network activity, nor does it seem to import network-related functions or DLLs.

**3. What are the malwareâ€™s host-based indicators?** 

> The observation of the above .log filename combined with a CreateFile operation in Process Monitor for the path of the folder that the malware was executed from prompted a visit to the folder that originally contained the malware. Sure enough, a new text file existed within the folder containing the names of any windows I had opened since running the malware, along with the keystrokes of anything I had typed within the window.

**4. What is the purpose of this program?**

> It's a keylogger, seemingly without network functionality which means an actor would have to physically compromise the system or pair this malware with network-enabled malware in order to remove the log file containing any recorded keystrokes.
