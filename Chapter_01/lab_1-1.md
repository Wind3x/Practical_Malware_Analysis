# Long Answers to Short Questions

1. Upload the files to http://www.VirusTotal.com/ and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signatures?

> Using VirusTotal, the executable file is picked up by 37/63 Antivirus engines at the time of analysis. It is most commonly identified as a Win32 (Generic) Trojan. 

> Using VirusTotal, the dynamic-link library file is picked up by 26/63 Antivirus engines at the time of analysis. It is most commonly identified as a (Generic) Trojan.

Hypothesis: likely Trojan

2. When were these files compiled?

> Using PEview, the executable has a compile Time Date Stamp of 2010/12/19 Sun 16:16:19 UTC. Also using PEview, the dynamic-link library file has a compile Time Date Stamp of 2010/12/19 Sun 16:16:38 UTC.

> The dynamic-link library appears to have been compiled seconds after the executable. 

Hypothesis: created by the same author at the same time, probably related. Dynamic-link libraries cannot run on their own, so the dll is probably used by the executable. 

3. Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators?

> Neither file seems packed, the IMAGE_SECTION_HEADERS each have a virtual size that is smaller than the size of raw data. Neither file seems obfuscated, both include a number of human-readable strings and function names.

> Using PEiD, the executable appears to have been compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, and the dll as well. 

> Of note is that the dll does not appear to export any functions, which is odd. 

Hypothesis: the files are neither packed nor obfuscated.

4. Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports are they?

> Using Dependency Walkter, the executable file:

> Access/change memory, files, hardware: Kernel32.dll
>  FindFirstFile, FindNextFile, and CopyFile are of interest, the program has the ability to search directories and copy files.
> Other C Library functionality: MSVCRT.dll

> Using Dependency Walker, the dynamic-link library file:

> Access/change memory, files, hardware: Kernel32.dll
>  Ability to modify processes and threads (CreateProcessA) and also potentially hide (Sleep)
> Network functionality: Ws2_32.dll
>   The functions here are imported by ordinal, so meaning cannot be derived from their names.
> Other C Library functionality: MSVCRT.dll

Hypothesis: The program has the ability to search for and copy files. The program also includes the ability to create processes and sleep when not in use, possibly to reduce detection. Network functionality may be indicative of an exfiltration or remote access mechanism, such as a backdoor.

5. Are there any other files or host-based indicators that you could look for on infected systems?

> Running strings on the executable file shows a suspicious filename of kerne132.dll with a path of C:\windows\system32\kerne132.dll which does not seem to be a normal dll according to Google.

> Running strings on the dynamic-link library shows a potential network resource of 127.26.152.13 

Hypothesis: the kerne132.dll is meant to impersonate kernel32.dll. The inclusion of network indicators is further proof of exfil / backdoor functionality.

6. What network-based indicators could be used to find this malware on infected machines?

> The sole apparent network indicator of 127.26.152.13 was found above.

7. What would you guess is the purpose of these files?

> Identification by VirusTotal as a Trojan, as well as the above analysis, indicates that the program is likely a trojan with the ability to find, copy, and potentially export files over the network. The dynamic-link library with the network functionality may act as a networked backdoor while the executable may be downloaded and executed to install and run the dynamic-link library. Strings of exec, hello, and sleep found in the dll also indicate the ability to remotely create processes via a backdoor which is put to sleep when not in use.
