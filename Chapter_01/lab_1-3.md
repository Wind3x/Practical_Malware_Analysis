# Long Answers to Short Questions

1. Upload the Lab01-03.exe file to http://www.VirusTotal.com/. Does it match any existing antivirus definitions?

> Using VirusTotal, the file is picked up by 53/64 Antivirus engines at the time of analysis. It is most commonly identified as a Trojan or Packer.

Hypothesis: Potentially a packer or packed binary.

2. Are there any indications that this file is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators? If the file is packed, unpack it if possible. 

> PEiD identifies the file as being **FSG 1.0 dulek/xt** packed. Strings shows common wrapper functions **LoadLibraryA** and **GetProcAddress**. PEview shows each (apparently unnamed) section as having a smaller Size of Raw Data than Virtual Size.

> At this time, we do not have the tools or knowledge to unpack the binary. Online resources show that it may be feasible via OllyDbg or by downloading the packer program from some sketchy sites.

Hypothesis: Being packed is further indication of this file's probable maliciousness.

3. Do any imports hint at this programâ€™s functionality? If so, which imports are they and what do they tell you?

> Dependency Walkter shows that the packed file has some imports common to packed executables, such as **LoadLibraryA** and **GetProcAddress**.

Hypothesis: The program is packed and no further information may be gleaned at this time :(

4. What host- or network-based indicators could be used to identify this malware on infected machines? 

> Using either Strings or FLOSS (FireEye Labs Obfuscated String Solver) on the packed file doesn't give us much more information than what was obtained above. 

Hypothesis: The program is likely malicious (as identified by VirusTotal) but is FSG packed and will require future tooling / knowledge for further analysis.
