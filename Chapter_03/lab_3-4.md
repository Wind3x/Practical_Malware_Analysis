# Short Answers to Short Questions

**1. What happens when you run this file?**

> Running the file spawns a command shell briefly and then removes the executable file.

**2. What is causing the roadblock in dynamic analysis?**

> Strings output for this executable suggests it might be a network-enabled backdoor or custom shell. It is self-deleting and may have anti-vm features, or may require some component of the environment (software, keys, user interaction) to run properly.

**3. Are there other ways to run this program?**

> The program seems to import functions related to the modification of services, the registry, files, and some network functionality. There does not seem to be a way to run the malware as a service or provide any inputs that cause it to not delete itself immediately.
