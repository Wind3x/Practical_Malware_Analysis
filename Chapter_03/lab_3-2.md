# Long Answers to Short Questions

1. How can you get this malware to install itself?

> Using Dependency Walker to look at functions exported by the DLL, we can see that it exports two functions that seem likely to assist with installation: installA and Install. The presence of a ServiceMain function suggest that the program will need to be installed as a service in order to run which can be achieved by running ```rundll32.exe <dll_name>,<function>```.

Hypothesis: Looking at functions imported by the DLL, it may have the ability to create and modify services, registry entries, and imports network functionality from Ws2_32 and Wininet. The malware may utilize the registry for persistence and network communications for command and control. The malware seems slightly obfuscated, with strings output including some base64-encoded strings such as **Y29ubmVjdA==** (connect). Strings output further includes potential network indicators (domains, user agent strings, html resources) and host indicators (registry paths, file paths). One of the most interesting things turned up by running strings against the DLL is what seems to be the name and description of a program, potentially what the malware is masquerading as: _Depends INA+, Collects and stores network configuration and location information, and notifies applications when this information changes._
