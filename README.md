## General Description
The purpose of this independent study is to evaluate a potential curriculum that could be developed into a Special Topics or regular Informatics course as part of the Information Assurance and Cybersecurity track. The topics covered in such a course would include technical skills such as malware analysis and general reverse engineering tools and techniques, as well as soft skills such as doing technical work in a collaborative environment and presenting findings to semi- and non-technical audiences. These skills are essential and  often required for students wishing to enter the Cybersecurity industry as part of a team of Incident Responders, Penetration Testers, Digital Forensic Investigators, or general Security Engineers. 

## Learning Objectives
* Understand the attacker mindset and how to utilize this perspective in various scenarios
* Communicate technical information to non-, semi-, and fully-technical audiences
* Work on technical challenges in a collaborative environment
* Acquire foundational knowledge of malware, analysis tools, and techniques
* Be able to properly perform basic static and dynamic analysis of samples
* Become familiar with advanced tools and techniques used in static and dynamic analysis
* Detect and defeat anti-reverse-engineering techniques employed by attackers
* Be exposed to special topics in malware analysis for further development
* Develop a class for iSchool students to also learn the above as part of the IAC track

## Resources
* Textbook - required - Practical Malware Analysis by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig
* Textbook - supplemental - Practical Reverse Engineering by Bruce Dang
* Textbook - supplemental - Hacking: The Art of Exploitation by Jon Erickson

## Activities
* Review the contents of the textbook (~2 chapters per week) to determine quality and content-accessibility by iSchool students
* Asses lab-exercises (accessibility, rigor) as applicable to iSchool students
* Develop a proposal for curriculum and materials

## Deliverables
* GitHub repository of completed lab exercises with any slides/notes relevant to course
* Mock syllabus for the proposed course including a timeline, prerequisites, learning objectives, and materials

## Assessment Method
* Review weekly GitHub submissions for completeness and quality
* Review proposal (syllabus) for quality, completeness, and feasibility of implementation
