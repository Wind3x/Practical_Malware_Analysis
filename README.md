*Kristina Savelesky* | *Updated 30 January 2018*

## General Description
The purpose of this independent study was to evaluate a potential curriculum that could be developed into a Special Topics or regular Informatics course as part of the Information Assurance and Cybersecurity track. The topics covered in such a course include technical skills such as malware analysis and general reverse engineering tools and techniques, as well as soft skills such as doing technical work in a collaborative environment and presenting findings to semi- and non-technical audiences. These skills are essential and  often required for students wishing to enter the Cybersecurity industry as part of a team of Incident Responders, Penetration Testers, Digital Forensic Investigators, or general Security Engineers. 

## Learning Objectives
* Understand the attacker mindset and how to utilize this perspective in various scenarios
* Communicate technical information to non-, semi-, and fully-technical audiences
* Work on technical challenges in a collaborative environment
* Acquire foundational knowledge of malware, analysis tools, and techniques
* Be able to properly perform basic static and dynamic analysis of samples
* Become familiar with advanced tools and techniques used in static and dynamic analysis
* Detect and defeat anti-reverse engineering techniques employed by attackers
* Be exposed to special topics in malware analysis for further development
